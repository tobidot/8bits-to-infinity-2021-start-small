this is my entry to the 2021 Jam : [8bits-to-infinity](https://itch.io/jam/text-only-jam-2)
Theme : start-small

## Description

This is a little puzzle-game you could maybe describe as a crossover between Candy Crush, Sudoku and Tertis.
You have to clear as many letters from the board as possible.
By pressing a letter on the keyboard all instances of this letter will increase, surch that A's become B and B's become C and so on.
When reaching Z the letter will then again move to A.



## Development and Tools

I used [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to write this game and [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to bundle the project into an html project.
For the music I used [Bosca Ceoil](https://boscaceoil.net/).
